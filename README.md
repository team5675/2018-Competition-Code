# Mattawan WiredCats 2018

Official GitHub page for Mattawan Wired Cats' 2018 season.

## Using and developing the frc-5675-dashboard
To make setting up automonous, data analyization, tune ups, and in-round robot statistics easier to work with, I decide to do a standalone driver station dashboard.

### Dependences
* Node.js
* Python 3.x.x
* Python 2.x.x

### Running the dashboard
1. Open up CMD by typing "CMD" in the Windows search bar.
2. Type in cd, then in the GitHub folder (C:\Users\YourName\Documents\GitHub\MattawanWiredCats2018) drag the frc-5675-dashboard folder to CMD. After the dragging, you should see something like the following text in your CMD window:
```
C:\Users\jetlo>cd C:\Users\jetlo\Documents\GitHub\MattawanWiredCats2018\frc-5675-dashboard
```
Then press enter.
3. Type in
```
npm start
```
and the dashboard will start.

### Developing the dashboard
I personally like using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), however you can use whatever you want to edit the files. The dashboard was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (not to be confused with Java, they are two different things.)
